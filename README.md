## About

This is a command-line version of the classic Hangman game we all know.

The classic game is played by guessing a randomly generated word by picking an individual letters on each go. Each player will get to keep guessing a letter until they either get the correct word or the hanging man shows. The hanging man will show after 10 incorrect guesses.

The objective of the game is to correctly guess the randomly generated word before the hanging man shows.
